# Executable Phase Contracts

V.I.O.L.E.T. phase contracts are machine-readable gates for phase summaries.
They exist because governance, reports, prompts, and review comments cannot be
the only guard for pipeline-critical work.

## Command

```powershell
& "$PY" scripts/check_phase_contract.py --list-contracts
& "$PY" scripts/check_phase_contract.py --contract <contract_id> --summary <summary.json>
& "$PY" scripts/check_phase_contract.py --contract <contract_id> --summary <summary.json> --explain
```

The checker prints JSON to stdout and exits nonzero on failure.

## Contract Rule

Any phase that claims `target_met`, `route_approved`, `full_chain_completed`,
or `safe_to_merge` must declare a registered contract and pass the contract
checker before making that claim. If no matching contract exists, create or
extend a contract first.

## R1R Gate

`source_concept_full_chain_contract_v1` is mandatory before any R1R completion
claim. It distinguishes deterministic-only output from full-chain completion
and fails if a phase silently skips required bounded LLM pair adjudication while
claiming full-chain completion.

`r1r_full_source_concept_pipeline_contract_v1` is the focused SCV2-R1R replay
contract. It requires development/test/restored-snapshot isolation, a
stage-level SC1 required-stage manifest, LLM pair planning/selection/judgment
truthfulness, SourceConcept-owned write scope, mutation proof, review-pack
manifest inclusion, public redaction, and explicit downstream route
non-authorization. `target_met_full_chain` also requires primary
OpenAI-compatible provider/model identity, no fallback provider use, and zero
provider/judgment errors. It also requires the standard SourceConcept LLM
adjudication cache policy: a private ignored durable cache root label, atomic
cache-write proof, exact-compatible cache accounting, provider-failure
exclusion, projected/actual cost fields, and redacted public aggregate cache
reporting. A fixed call cap such as 300 pairs is not sufficient route evidence
when all eligible pairs fit within the approved budget. It allows truthful
blocked statuses, but only `target_met_full_chain` may claim full-chain
completion.

See `docs/source-concept-llm-adjudication-cache.md` for the durable cache and
checkpoint/reuse standard shared by R1R and future full-library SourceConcept
phases.

## Route Gate

`route_audit_contract_v1` is mandatory for route-decision phases. A route cannot
be approved while an upstream pipeline contract is failed, deterministic-only,
or incomplete. For SCV2-A1R summaries, it also enforces the explicit A1R status
vocabulary, at most one recommended next phase, explicit downstream/truth/
production non-authorization flags, public redaction, review-pack integrity, and
the required next contract when a single next phase is recommended.

## Public Artifact Gate

`public_redaction_contract_v1` and `review_pack_contract_v1` make public
artifact and review-pack checks executable. They scan both keys and values, and
they fail on local paths, tokens, unredacted secret-looking fields, raw private
labels, stale or incomplete review-pack manifests, and final-file-set redaction
gaps.
