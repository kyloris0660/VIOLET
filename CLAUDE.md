# CLAUDE.md

This project is V.I.O.L.E.T. (Visual Image Organizer for Local Evaluation & Tagging), a local-first anime image library based on Blombooru.

## Before coding, read these files

- `AGENTS.md` — Agent instructions, architecture, key code locations
- `README.md` — Project overview, feature status, quick start
- `docs/current-handoff.md` — Latest development state
- `docs/project-roadmap.md` — Full phase plan

## Critical workflow rules

### GitHub PR / main protection

Agents may:
- Create feature branches, commit changes, push feature branches
- Create GitHub PRs, update existing PR branches
- Run tests, prepare local validation servers

Agents must NOT:
- Merge PRs
- Push directly to `main`
- Force-push `main`
- Delete `main`
- Treat local commits as PRs
- Claim a PR exists without a real GitHub PR URL (e.g. from `gh pr view` or `gh pr create`)
- Claim a PR is merged without GitHub or `origin/main` verification

The user manually reviews and merges PRs on GitHub.

### Real browser validation (mandatory)

For every feature phase, bug fix, or UI-affecting change, the agent must perform real browser validation before delivery. This applies to changes involving: Admin UI, gallery/media grid, media detail page, search behavior, tag localization, AI tagging/review UI, local library scan workflow, settings/developer tools, user-visible text, thumbnails/fallback images, routing/navigation, any frontend JavaScript behavior.

**Required standard:**

1. Prefer Playwright with system Edge on Windows.
2. Do not rely only on API tests or unit tests when UI behavior is affected.
3. Use a real running local server.
4. Use the actual app page, not only mocked DOM tests.
5. Verify the relevant user flow end-to-end.
6. If the feature touches local files, scan, thumbnails, or media display, validate with a real local test folder when safe.
7. If real browser validation cannot be run, the agent must explicitly explain why and provide the closest fallback validation.

The delivery report must include a dedicated section: **真实浏览器验收**, containing: 验收方式, 浏览器/Playwright project, URL tested, pages/flows validated, pass/fail result, skipped or not covered items, fallback explanation if real browser validation could not be completed. A phase is not considered complete without this section.

### Phase plan approval rule

For every new major development phase or substantial feature scope, the agent must first produce an implementation plan and wait for explicit user approval before making substantial code changes. Bug fixes and small review-comment fixes may proceed without a separate plan. Major stage-level design changes (classifiers, models, DB schemas, evaluation frameworks) require the plan first.

### Chinese reporting rule

Final user-facing stage summaries and delivery reports must be written in Chinese. This includes: 阶段性总结, 交付报告, 测试结果总结, 风险说明, 本地验收步骤, 已知限制, 下一步建议.

Keep technical identifiers in English: file paths, branch names, PR URLs, API routes, config keys, class/function names, commands, commit messages, PR titles. Code comments may remain English when appropriate.

### Test report accuracy

- Do not claim "all tests passed" if any test failed.
- If some tests are skipped, gated, unavailable, or unrelated, the report must say so clearly.
- The final delivery report must include exact commands and exact results.
- If a failing test is pre-existing or unrelated, the agent must either: (1) fix it; (2) gate/skip it intentionally with a clear reason; or (3) document it as non-blocking with evidence.

### Service / dev environment safety

- Never kill arbitrary Python or Node processes.
- Only stop clearly identified V.I.O.L.E.T. / AnimeLocalBooru dev server processes.
- Report PID, command line, and port before stopping.
- Prefer diagnostics-first UI.
- If adding stop/restart UI, restrict it to local debug mode only.
- Do not expose dangerous controls in production mode.

## Do not commit

`.env`, API keys, `data/`, `media/`, `storage/`, `backups/`, model files, `node_modules/`, `test-results/`, `playwright-report/`, traces, screenshots.

## Environment

- Windows local dev
- GitHub CLI: `C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe` (usually available as `gh` in PATH)
- If `gh` is not found in PATH, use the absolute path above. Do not claim `gh` is unavailable unless both `where gh` and `& "C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe" --version` fail.
- Dev server: `python run.py --debug` → `http://localhost:8000`
- Database: PostgreSQL 17, `blombooru` on `localhost:5432`

## Language policy

| Layer | Language |
|-------|----------|
| User interface | zh-CN first (English fallback) |
| Internal code, API, config, canonical tags | English |
| Core technical docs | English primary |
| Delivery reports / stage summaries | Chinese (zh-CN) |

## Runtime LLM configuration

Runtime tag translation / alias resolution uses configurable OpenAI-compatible LLM via `.env`:
- `TAG_TRANSLATION_LLM_PROVIDER`, `TAG_TRANSLATION_LLM_BASE_URL`, `TAG_TRANSLATION_LLM_API_KEY`, `TAG_TRANSLATION_LLM_MODEL`
- Do not hardcode any specific runtime LLM model.
